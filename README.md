My personal site.

Built with React, Typescript, Styled Components, Jest, Netlify and Babel.

My goal with this site has been to maximize performance, developer UX and
especially code quality. I wanted to learn what a modern React + Typescript
frontend with zero corners cut looks like.

Will follow up with a blog post soon.
